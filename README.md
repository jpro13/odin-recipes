# odin-recipes

The goal of this project was to create a rudimentary recipe website.

For each web page I demonstrated the use of html elements such as:
- Titles
- Relative links to pages within the website.
- Paragraphs for a short description about the recipe.
- Headers, different sizes depending on the context.
- Images
- Unordered lists for the ingredients.
- Ordered lists for the steps.

I also demonstrated the use of Git via the terminal. Making sure to stage files before committing them. Making commits when I found it appropriate to e.g when adding new recipe pages or making significant changes to the content of a page. Pushing commits to GitHub when there were enough local commits piled up.
