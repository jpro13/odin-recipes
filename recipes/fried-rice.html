    <ol>
        <li>To cook this recipe, soak the rice in water for at least 20 minutes before starting. Wash and marinate the chicken in some salt and black pepper for 20 minutes. Now, add 2 cups of water in a pan and let it come to a boil. To this, add the rice and let them cook until 80% done. Drain the rice and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Now that the chicken has been marinated, add some oil to a hot pan and add in the chicken. Cook it until it changes colour to a light golden. Take it out and keep aside. Now add 1 tbsp of oil into the pan again and stir fry the finely chopped garlic and add the onion. Cook this for 35 seconds and add in the rest of the vegetables and cook on high flame for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, to this, add black pepper and salt according to taste along with all your sauces and mix well. Add the rice and chicken and stir well without breaking the rice. Cover and let it cook for 30 seconds. Turn the flame off and drizzle the vinegar and cover again. Serve after 10 minutes!</li>
